Double-click a file, make changes, and save it back to disk: That’s how productivity apps, IDEs, and image editors have
been working since the early days of desktop computing. Until now, web applications could not integrate into this
workflow. Fortunately, Project Fugu, a cross-vendor initiative by Google, Microsoft, and Intel, aims to bring very
powerful native capabilities to the web—file handler registrations, clipboard, and file system access included! This
allows web developers like you to finally bring Office-style apps, IDEs, text, image, or video editors to the web.
Christian Liebel and Steffen Jahr from Thinktecture shows you how to integrate Native File System and File Handler API into your Angular
app.
